# Image Classification with Code Engine

> Companion code sample to the [Code Engine solution tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-image_classification_code_engine)

Following the steps in the [solution tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-image_classification_code_engine) and using this code sample, you will learn about [IBM Cloudâ„¢ Code Engine](https://cloud.ibm.com/codeengine/overview) by deploying an image classification application.

You will create a Code Engine project, select the project and deploy Code Engine components - applications and jobs to the project. You will learn how to bind IBM Cloud services (Cloud Object Storage and Visual Recognition) to your Code Engine components. You will also understand the auto-scaling capability of Code Engine where instances are scaled up or down (to zero) based on incoming workload.
